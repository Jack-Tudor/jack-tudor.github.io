										I am a PhD student in the School of Social Sciences at Swansea University. My primary research interests centre on sources of error in pre-election polling, exploring in particular the multi-level decomposition of polling error and the importance of election-level factors in instances of misprediction. 
										
										My work in these areas has been published in <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17457289.2021.1972305?forwardService=showFullText&tokenAccess=RIKXDJGEH5NWCAYMFGMX&tokenDomain=eprints&doi=10.1080%2F17457289.2021.1972305&doi=10.1080%2F17457289.2021.1972305&doi=10.1080%2F17457289.2021.1972305&target=10.1080%2F17457289.2021.1972305&journalCode=fbep20"> The Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties</a>,

										<br>
										<br>

										I have applied my training in statistics and data analysis to a wide range of research areas, including the creation of <a href="https://globaldrugpolicyindex.net/"> The Global Drugs Policy Index</a> whilst working as a <a href="https://www.swansea.ac.uk/gdpo/projectpages/global-drug-policy-index-gdpi/"> research assistant</a> for the <a href="https://www.swansea.ac.uk/gdpo/gdpopeople/team/#d.en.24412=&jack-tudor=is-expanded"> Global Drugs Policy Observatory</a>.
										Research projects that I have been part of have been featured in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/nov/07/youll-never-have-a-drug-free-society-expert-warns-uk"> The Guardian</a>,

										<br>
										<br>

										To date, my research has identified that election-level differences are a particularly important driver of pre-election polling error variance. My doctoral thesis further investigates this avenue of research by analysing the importance of election-level variables for the prediction of polling error, finding their presence useful in the reduction of root mean square error.
										
										<br>
										<br>

										Moving forward, my research agenda concerns further investigation of the influence of the election level on polling error, as well as progressing towards a deeper, system-level understanding of elections as phenomena and its ramifications for electoral forecasting.
